                <p>Also, if you submit a resume or application for employment with iHype via e-mail, you will be required to include personally-identifiable information so that iHype can adequately review your application and contact you. iHype may collect and store the information you choose to provide us in order to send you information about iHype from time to time.</p>
    
                <h4>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non Personally-Identifiable Information</h4>

                <p>An IP Address is a number used by computers on a network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you. We collect IP Address information in order to administer our web site and to gather broad demographic information.</p>
                <h4>Cookies</h4>
